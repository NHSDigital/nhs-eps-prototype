       <ol> 
       
        <li>Legal obligation: Article 6(1)(c) of UK GDPR. This is because the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has issued NHS England with a legal Direction to provide the Electronic Prescriptions Service, which includes the CPTS.  This Direction is called the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/spine-services-no-2-2014-direction">Spine Services (No.2) 2014 Direction</a>. </li>

      </ol>
   <p>
